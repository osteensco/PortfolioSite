    <p>
        I wanted to create a simple proof of concept webhook, and an easy use case is providing real time messaging when events occur.
        I also needed an easy way to monitor web traffic on my portfolio to get a sense of how often it gets viewed.
        Many applications have built in webhooks and/or endpoints for similar purposes that are easy to integrate with. Discord is one example
        and is what I used to set up an endpoint for real time messaging. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I also wanted to ingest the data I was getting from the traffic to my portfolio in case I ever wanted to any sort of model 
        building or analysis on the data in the future. I knew that I wanted this data to ultimately land in BigQuery, so I decided to use 
        existing infrastructure I built as part of my Data Pipeline project. While one Webhook lands in a Discord channel, the other sends the Post 
        Request to an HTTP triggered Google Cloud Function that acts as the endpoint. This Cloud Function provides a response and publishes 
        the Request body to a Google Pub/Sub topic. This topic then triggers the appropriate Data Pipeline Cloud Function which cleans and prepares 
        the data to land in BigQuery.
    </p>
    <p>            
        Both this webhook and the one posting to Discord were built off the same class using Javascript. The class provides the framework for 
        gathering data and sending the Post Request. Whenever a page is loaded, a Webhook object is created for each endpoint and executes their 
        workflows.
