    <img src="{{ DataPipeline_Diagram.url }}" class="img-fluid col-md-7 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" style="aspect-ratio: 2/1"/>
    <p>
    For each data source I use a python script in a Google Cloud Function, which is continuously deployed by a google 
    cloud build trigged off of push requests to the Github repo. The code is the same for each, but each data source 
    has it's own object, execution function, and yaml file to define the correct entry point and follow the correct workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Cloud Function is run off a daily Pub/Sub call from Cloud Scheduler, or is triggered when a Google Cloud Function HTTP 
    Endpoint publishes a message to the Pub/Sub topic that the Cloud Function is subscribed to. The pipeline verifies if it's DataSource 
    needs to be ingested or not to avoid duplicated data and actions appropriately.
    </p>
    <p>
    I used an Object Oriented approach for the design of the pipeline. I created a unique child 
    DataSource object for each set of data I am ingesting which are fed through a Pipeline object 
    that handles fetching API keys, scheduling, and general process flow. The DataSource objects 
    are designed to handle the ETL steps required, and land the data into the appropriate table in Google Bigquery.
    </p>
    <p>
    The pipeline is simple to scale as it only requires a child DataSource object and a yaml file to 
    be created in order to integrate an additional ingestion need.
