    <p>
    This project provides a scalable framework for developing batch and streaming data pipelines stemming from a variety of sources. 
    For each data source I use a Google Cloud Function written in python, which is continuously deployed by a google 
    cloud build trigged off of push requests to the Github repo. The code is the same for each GCF, but each data source 
    has it's own object, execution function, and yaml file to define the correct entry point and follow the proper workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Cloud Function is executed by a daily Pub/Sub call from Cloud Scheduler, or it is triggered by a HTTP Google Cloud Function 
    Endpoint receiving a push request and publishing a message to the Pub/Sub topic that the Data Source Cloud Function is subscribed to. 
    When triggered, the Pipeline object executes checks to ensure data is not duplicated and verifies if the DataSource object needs to be ingested or not.
    </p>
    <p>
    I used an Object Oriented approach for the design of the pipeline. I created a unique child 
    DataSource object for each set of data I am ingesting which are fed through a Pipeline object 
    that handles fetching API keys, scheduling, and general process flow. The DataSource objects 
    are designed to handle the ETL steps required, and land the data into the appropriate table in Google Bigquery.
    </p>
    <p>
    The pipeline is simple to scale as it will only require a new child DataSource object and yaml file to 
    be created in order to integrate a new batch ingestion need. A new endpoint along with the DataSource object 
    and yaml file will also need to be developed for any new streaming pipeline.
    </p>
