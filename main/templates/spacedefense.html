        <p class="row py-2">
        This project displays a solid understanding of OOP with many objects interacting 
        and altering each other. Most classes are child classes that utilize inheritance. There are 
        menu classes to help provide navigation and creating a game instance, ship classes to handle 
        boss's and enemies, drops, lasers, visual effects and more.

        <h6 class="text-left py-2">Dynamic Bosses</h6>
        <p class="row py-2">
        Each Boss you face is procedurally generated with a different body, weapon, and 
        apparatus. Each boss weapon and apparatus have their own mechanics and nuances.
        For example, one of weapons may do extensively more damage and even cut through the 
        toughest of defenses, while another will lie in wait while blending in with the vastness 
        of space. The boss apparetuses can provide extra defense, spawn drones to help fight, or 
        help turn the player's own attacks against them.

        <h6 class="text-left py-2">Power Up Drops</h6>
        <p class="row py-2">
        As enemies are defeated they have a change to drop capsules that will provide some
        sort of power boost to the player. The effects of these can be many different things 
        from increasing the player's fire rate to providing a temporarily powerful shield that 
        destroy's enemy ships and protects the player from (almost) anything.
