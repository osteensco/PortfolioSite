        <h6 class="text-left py-2">Object Oriented Programming</h6>
        <p class="row py-2">
        The game is made using OOP with parent and child classes utilizing inheritance. As an example,
        there are menu subclasses to help provide navigation, change settings, and creating a game instance. 
        There is also a ship class with several sublasses to handle boss's and enemies, as well as the player's actions, score and health.

        <h6 class="text-left py-2">Dynamic Bosses</h6>
        <p class="row py-2">
        Each Boss you face is procedurally generated with a different body, weapon, and 
        apparatus. Each boss weapon and apparatus have their own mechanics and nuances.
        For example, one of the weapons may do extensively more damage and even cut through the 
        toughest of defenses, while another will lie in wait while blending in with the vastness 
        of space. The boss apparetuses can provide extra defense, spawn drones to help fight, or 
        help turn the player's own attacks against them.

        <h6 class="text-left py-2">Power Up Drops</h6>
        <p class="row py-2">
        As enemies are defeated they have a chance to drop capsules that will provide some
        sort of power boost to the player. The effects of these can be many different things 
        from increasing the player's fire rate to providing a temporarily powerful shield that 
        destroy's enemy ships and protects the player from (almost) anything.
